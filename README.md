# SensorPlus
A (clumnsy) version of software aimed at evaluating the performance of a motion, supported by Myo armband.  

Need to run the drive of Myo Armband.  

Unaccompanied practice mode: used when you are not accompanied with a human expert, wherein SensorPlus will evaluate your motion so that you will have a benchmark for your own practice.  

Accompanied practice mode: used when you are accompanied with a human expert, wherein you can compare the score from the software and that of your coach; you can manually overwrite the score so that it can be used in training the neural network which is used in the evaluation of your motion.  

This is a simple project finished with a hope that after getting the advice of your coach, you can make better use of your time at home in a way that you will not practive in a wrong way without knowing it. We hope the user can make better use of the 90% of time at home.
