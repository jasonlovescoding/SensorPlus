Accompanied practice mode: used when you are accompanied with a human expert, wherein you can compare the score from the software and that of your coach; you can manually overwrite the score so that it can be used in training the neural network which is used in the evaluation of your motion.  

This is a simple project finished with a hope that after getting the advice of your coach, you can make better use of your time at home in a way that you will not practive in a wrong way without knowing it. We hope the user can make better use of the 90% of time at home.
